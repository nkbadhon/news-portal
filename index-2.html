        <h3><span class="text-primary">Quesion 1.</span> What is the difference in between var let const?
        </h3>
        <h3 class="ms-4"><span class="text-warning">Answer: </span>Var declarations are globally scoped or function
            scoped, while let and const are block scoped. Var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;
            let variables can be updated but not
            re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
            They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let
            and const variables are not initialized.
            While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

        <h3><span class="text-primary">Quesion 2.</span> Differences between Arrow function and regular function?</h3>
        <h3 class="ms-4"><span class="text-warning">Answer: </span> An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow
            function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function
            expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are
            some differences between them. The differences are: - <br>

            1. Syntax <br>
            2. Arguments binding <br>
            3. Use of this keyword <br>
            4. Using a new keyword <br>
        </h3>
        <h3><span class="text-primary">Quesion 3.</span> Why do we use template sttring?</h3>
        <h3 class="ms-4"><span class="text-warning">Answer: </span>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern
            JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without
            needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex
            and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are
            functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for
            converting strings to different entities.
